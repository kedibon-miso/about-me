 <p style ="font-style: italic;">  I am on journey of transitioning from the world of biochemistry to the exciting realm of Technology.While my background lies in the fascinating field of biochemistry, I have always been fascinated by the power of technology and its ability to better and shape our lives. Driven by my curiosity and a strong desire to learn, I have taken the leap into the Python development bootcamp by Girlcode to explore this exciting new field.<br>
Although my journey is just beginning, I am committed to embracing the opportunities and challenges that come with learning this programming language. I am eager to gain skills to develop innovative solutions and contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology.I am excited to explore applications of this versatile language, such as web development through my projects, and I aim to inspire others who might be embarking on a similar journey.</p>
