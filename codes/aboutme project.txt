 <p style ="font-style: italic;">Hi, I am Kedibone Modise, a 25-year-old woman with a passion for both science and technology. Armed with an Honors Degree in Biochemistry, I have spent my academic years unraveling the complexities of molecules and reactions. But life had another adventure in store for me â€“ web development. I thrive on challenges and problem-solving, which are important not only in the lab but also in the world of coding, and I approach coding projects with the same passion that I did my research.Beyond my technical skills, I also bring to web development an adaptable and open-minded personality. The world of Web development is constantly evolving, just like scientific discoveries, and I welcome this constant learning required in this field.</p>
